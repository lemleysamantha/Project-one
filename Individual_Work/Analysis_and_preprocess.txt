2. Analysis

	- Assume that nobody would like to purchase cars that are more than 20 years old.
	- Also assume that nobody would try to avoid cars that have already travelled more than 200000 miles
	- Price trend: The newer the year of entry is, the higher the used car price is.
	- Clean title, gas, and automatic transmission looks like a standard. 
	- Odometer of the car may affect the upper limit of the used car price.
