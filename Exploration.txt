1. Exploration phase

	- The original dataset contains 426,880 rows with 26 columns.
	- Based on relevance of each column to our analysis and the number of available, i.e., not NaN, values in the column, decided to focus on the fullowing columns:
		Price, year, manufacturer, model, condition, cylinders, fuel, odometer, title status, transmission, drive, and type
	- Also, 'id' column will be kept for identification.
	- Any rows that include NaN data have been removed from the dataset, which then contains 127,232 rows with 13 columns.
		i)	Id, price, year, and odometer are numerical.
		ii)	Manufacturer, model, condition, cylinders, fuel, title status, transmission, drive, and type are object.
	- Id and year could be converted into object and date, respectively.
	- In addition, cylinders will be processed and used as number for further analysis.

	- Exploration of each column
		a. Id			Converted into object and used as data identification
		b. Price		Maximum value is 3.7e+09. There will be outliers to be removed.
		c. Year		Some old years will be eliminated.
		d. Manufacturer	40 manufacturer. Top five includes ford, chevrolet, toyota, hond, and nissan
		e. Model		12,096 models. Preprocessing will be needed.
		f. Condition	Major conditions are excellent, good, and like new. Similar conditions could be combined. 
		g. Cylinders	Major cylinders are 6, 4, 8 cylinders.
		h. Fuel		Over 90% of values are gas.
		i. Odometer		Maximum value is 1.0e+07. There will be outliers to be removed.
		j. Title status	Over 95% of values are clean.
		k. Transmission	Over 80% of values are automatic.
		l. Drive		Values include 4wd, fwd, and rwd. Each of three accounts for over 20%.	
		m. Type		There are 13 types, which could be preprocessed.
