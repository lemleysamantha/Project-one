# Project-one
# Topic Selected:  Used Cars Price Prediction

## Background:
Over the past few years, the automotive industry has faced a shortage in the Semiconductor Integrate Chips globally. The Semicoductor IC is a critical component for controlling several electronic devices in the vehicle. 
Even though the car industry is growing at a fast rate, the shortage is impeding the growth of new car production and sales. The new car sales industry is making up for the shortage by raising their APR and prices. Therefore, there is a trend of increasing demand of used cars which is making the prices of used cars higher as well.
Based on the current situation in the automotive industry, we have decided on predicting the prices of used cars for our project. Though it is a global issue, we will limit our studies and findings for US market only.

## Data Sources:
https://www.kaggle.com/code/maciejautuch/car-price-prediction/data
This dataset collected in Kaggle is mainly from craigslist.org (used item selling website) from all over US. These cars are from different manufacturers and of different years.

-------Here is the list of libraries we will be needing (may change):

## Questions to Answer:
1.	How does the mileage affect the price of the used car?
2.	How does size of the car impact the price?
3.	How does the age of the car, condition and fuel type affect the price of the car?
4.	Will this affect the overall demand for a used car in place of a new car for consumers?
## Steps to be taken:
Data Cleaning:
 that includes getting rid of all undesired columns
 
Creating table in SQL

Utilize Tableau 

Machine Learning Model:
this includes choosing **X** variable as a **collection of features** and **Y** as a target variable which will be **Price**

Model for Regression

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
K&N Algorithm
Decission Tree	
etc

## Data Exploration

We explored the data by creating box plots and subplots. We were able to better visualize the large amount of data that was given in the excel spreadsheet file. We found that the outliers did not make much sense. For examnple, Oregon had an average price of car at 1.6 million and California had an average price 139,000. Based on what we know about markets, California's average price should be way higher than Oregon's. We have found that our data also is not in one currency which could have skewed the numbers.

## Analysis

We were able to analyze the data by using the boxplots to visualize the outliers. The actual prices and the predicted prices were shown through the scatterplot.We were using tableau to get a better understanding of the prices and regions.

## Group Details:

We are team of four people. 
Shahla and Samantha are in charge of gathering information about the results of the dataset and what we want to achieve. Ryiochi was in charge of cleaning up the csv and dataset. Matthew was initializing our databases.
